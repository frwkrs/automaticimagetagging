# automatic-image-tagging

This will be my master thesis. Goal of the thesis is to use the libraries provided by deeplearning4j to automaticely tag pictures that are handed to the model. Hence the algorithm should learn to recognize what's on the pictures and add the correct tags.

# Dataset

The Training Dataset consists of different Images. They all have a disctinct number of tags (like a picture that has a lake, a house and a mountain on it will be tagged with "lake, house, mountain").
